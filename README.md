# Reinforcement-Learnign-Project2
In this project we train an agent using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to land the lunar lander on the lunar surface. We will use the Lunar Lander Environment (LunarLander-v2) from OpenAI Gym. The environment consists of a lander with 4 discrete actions and a continuous state space.
